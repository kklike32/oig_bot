You: How can I enable multiple accounts provisioning?
Chatbot: To enable multiple account provisioning in the context of Oracle Identity Manager, you must perform a series of steps.

First, it's important to note that by default, Oracle Identity Manager does not support multiple account provisioning. However, this functionality can be enabled by following the steps outlined in the product documentation.

Here's a comprehensive guide:
1. Setting the System Property:
   - Set the value of the system property 'XL.AllowAPBasedMultipleAccountProvisioning' to 'TRUE'. This property controls whether multiple account provisioning is allowed based on access policies.
   - Reference: Administering Oracle Identity Governance manual, section 'Creating and Managing System Properties'.

2. Defining Account Discriminator Attributes:
   - After enabling multiple account provisioning, you need to define account discriminator attributes. These attributes help identify and distinguish between multiple accounts of the same resource.
   - Launch the Design Console and update the process form by adding the required account discriminator attributes.
   - Reference: Section '17.6.1 Enabling Multiple Account Provisioning' in the product documentation.

3. Account Discriminator Attributes in Access Policies:
   - Create or modify access policies to include the account discriminator attributes defined in step 2. These attributes will help determine the uniqueness of each account being provisioned.
   - Reference: Chapter 'Access Policy Creation' and 'Managing Access Policies' in the product documentation.

4. Scheduled Task Evaluation:
   - Provisioning of accounts right after role assignment is done through a scheduled task named 'Evaluate User Policies'. You may need to wait for this task to run automatically, or you can manually trigger it.
   - Reference: Section '17.6.2 Creating Separate Accounts for the Same User and Same Resource on a Single Target System'.

By following these steps, you can enable multiple account provisioning. The process involves configuring system properties, defining discriminator attributes, and considering the scheduled task for policy evaluation.

For more detailed information and specific instructions, it is recommended to consult the Oracle Identity Manager documentation, particularly the sections referenced above. These sections provide in-depth guides and insights into each step and may include additional nuances or considerations.

You: How can I create a new rule in the Add Self Service Capability Policy Rule page?
Chatbot: To create a new rule using the Add Self Service Capability Policy Rule page, follow these steps:

1. Access the Oracle Identity System Administration portal and log in with the necessary privileges.

2. Navigate to the left pane and select "Self Service Capabilities." This action brings up the Self Service Capabilities page.

3. Locate the "Create" button on the toolbar and click it. The Add Self Service Capability Policy Rule page will appear.

4. In the "Create Rule" section, provide the following information:
   - Name: Enter a clear and descriptive name for your rule.
   - Description: You can add a detailed description of the rule to help administer it effectively.
   - Owner: Assign an owner or administrator to this rule. You can search and select the appropriate owner from the available options.
   - Status: Choose whether the rule should be enabled or disabled. Disabled rules are skipped during evaluation when a user is created.

5. Set up the rule conditions using the Condition Builder:
   - Click the condition builder icon under the "IF" part of the rule. A pop-up screen will appear, allowing you to construct the condition.
   - Select the desired User attribute from the attribute list. You can search for specific attributes or UDFs associated with the User entity.
   - Choose the appropriate condition from the conditions dropdown. Options include Equal, Not Equal, Contains, Does Not Contain, Begins With, and Does Not Begin With.
   - Enter the condition value or select it from the list. For example, if you chose "Begins With," you could specify a prefix that the attribute values should match.

6. Move on to the "THEN" part of the rule:
   - Click the condition builder icon in the "THEN" section.
   - Select either "Capability" or "Denied Attributes" based on your requirement.
   - Unlike the "IF" section, the condition here is fixed to "Equals."
   - Use the condition builder to choose the appropriate Capability or Denied Attribute. Remember that mandatory attributes and system-generated attributes like Status, Display Name, and User Login cannot be included in the denied attributes list.

7. Once you have defined the rule conditions to your satisfaction, you can either click "Update" to save and apply the changes or "Revert" to discard them.

By following these steps, you can create a new rule for self-service capabilities in the Oracle Identity Governance system.

For more detailed information and visuals of the process, refer to the Oracle documentation on "Creating a Rule in Self Service Capability Policy" and "Edit Self Service Capability Policy Rule," as cited in the reference section of this conversation.
